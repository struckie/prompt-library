# Prompt Library

Personal collection of AI prompts, templates, and prompt engineering patterns.

## Purpose

Learning repository for:
- Prompt engineering best practices
- Template development (React + Claude Code)
- Reusable prompt patterns for work and personal projects

## Structure
```
prompt-library/
├── templates/       # Reusable prompt templates
├── examples/        # Working examples and case studies
├── docs/            # Prompt engineering documentation
└── app/             # Future: React app for browsing (Claude Code project)
```

## Categories (Planned)

### Work (Uniper COODE)
- M365 Copilot prompts
- Intelligence gathering workflows
- Meeting extraction patterns
- Decision support templates

### Personal
- Homelab automation
- Media organization
- Photo cataloging
- Research workflows

### Learning
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Few-shot learning examples
- Chain-of-thought patterns
- System prompt design

## Future: Interactive App

**Goal:** Build React app with Claude Code to browse/search prompts

**Features (Planned):**
- Search prompts by category/tag
- Copy to clipboard
- Edit and customize templates
- Save favorites
- Version history

**Tech Stack:**
- React (frontend)
- Local storage or Firebase (persistence)
- Claude Code (development workflow)

## Contributing to This Repo

**This is a personal learning repo, but the structure is:**
1. Create prompt in `/templates/` or `/examples/`
2. Document purpose and usage
3. Tag with categories
4. Test before committing
